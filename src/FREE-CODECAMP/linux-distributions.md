## Linux Distributions OS ( Operating Systems )

The first official linux, version 0.02 was released on October 5, 1991 by a computer's scientist student from the university of helsinki named **Linus Torvalds**. One of his academic's project lead him to develop an entire system running through **UNIX** system calls. He further decided to make it available to public for free, presenting advantages and control users may achieve running the system in their computer. It wasn't easy to lead people to trust and adopt a system based from a research project of a singular student gave to school, while microsoft has already made big step in the market with their **windows OS**. Despite that Linus grap an opportunity to reach thousands of programmers over the world with internet to become parts of the Linux development earlier in the stage, making it an **open source** development, where qualified programmers of a dedicated built **Linux community** have access and ability to implement update to the original system. All on the behalf of what others programmers can suggest as improvements, from all over the world. Because this was a really excitement , developers make of linux's project not just a software system but a huge tool to learn also **hardware system** with the integration of thousands of **command lines** to carry must of the tasks in need. This central point is one of the most crucial why you should give Linux a try ? It's not just about a software! But a hardware too. But a hardware too. You can practically customize strong and secure optimized system based on your need as, any linux's user become by default a linuxâ€™s developer. In the series of observations following we will present some of the advantages that comes from Linux , cool features you may discover on using it , and the benefit power you unleash to become an administrator of your system before the need of external professional in complex troubleshooting.

### 1. Linux Robust and Secure

Linux has many distributions available. Among some of them are linux mint, fedora , openSuse, Ubuntu, Debian, and many else, the list is exhaustive. Each distribution is adapted to certain requirements that can support your computer. Some works good with pretty powerfull machine like Ubuntu, fedora,... some bound nicely with your old machine such as linux mint, linux lite ... This give linux a particular aspect to stay **robust** in any computer they are settled. Additionally you don't have to worry to much about **virus** when comes to use a linux distribution. You may encounter **bugs**, but don't really have to purchase antivirus to keep your computer safe of basic malwares. The level of **security** is quite huge, even with default settings. But always be cautious on resources you look and find over the net. There can still be threats, and some people might send malicious code programs to attack and destroy your system, linux bring just some cools way of doing things , adding particular tailored security. However be aware all system can be hacked and affected.

E.g : I have been using HP 630 Notebook (and recently HP 2000 Notebook PC) that i got since the year 2012 to run the Linux mint OS that allows me to write this article right now. And put away bugs systems that may occurs times to times. The distribution works well allowing me to do task from writing to coding , and as well as other learning like drawing with GIMP for example. This will be difficult, if it was to use this old PC with Windows system. I will certainly struggle encountering new software update that has requirements more than the match of my PC. Fortunately using Linux Mint distribution gives me accessibility to a set of software that update, are still fit with my device.

### 2. Become Good To configuring Hardware Systems

Skip the fear that merely maintains you as a simple user. Start understanding architecture of your computer, and any others things by constantly solving challenge you encounter. For those who don't have a clue of how **linux operating system** deal with issue. It isn't straightforward, you rarely have this magical **software** to download and run to set **issues**. You have to do it yourself, before getting to someone,mostly with command lines along the way. Linux is made by developers for developers. And when we mean developers it is not about people just writing code even if you yet need to know a little bit about the subject , is about people that like to learn of what are the actually causes of problems they face. Linux has a large community of websites and each time you bump into a problem you need to make your research on the net and over websites redirected follow the conversation of people who has found solution to the problems as they discuss on community about it, and how they did it. While this process can seem overwhelming at the first glance. I can ensure you, that you will learn more about **device and computer** by allowing yourself to do it , than all the entire time you merely focus reading articles that talk about solving specific problems on a device. This process is practical and analytical. You don't just follow what is said over the community but you constantly question yourself more about the details of issues, on which you are going through.

E.g : You can't easily **format** a USB plug into your PC. You will be asked to authenticate as a **superuser** (root account password of the user's owner of the system) to do that. And after a linux installation there is a procedure to follow to register as a superuser for your system.

### 3. Linux allow Flexibility

You don't need to uninstall your **windows** or **Mac** operating system to run **linux** in your machine.
Linux allows installation in a USB (USB Stick), or as a **dual boot** system. You then open the system by running the `USB Stick` plugs in your computer or booting to a linux distribution installed into your machine. This flexibility allows at any time you feel, to work with Linux, to give it a shot quickly. The system is fast and friendly looking, and you will be amaze by how much things you can do with native embedded software.

E.g : **Microsoft** Company , that found **windows** OS are also giving linux an entrance to their system by developing a **subsystem for linux** that will allow linux's users to run a linux environment directly on their windows OS without having to boot on a linux's system or even plug an USB Stick.

### 4. Linux is Portable

Take your **work** with you , and make update on any computer , anywhere , anytime by creating a **computer-on-a-stick\*** (also called `live USB` or `USB Stick`) of a linux system of your choice. You need at least to have a USB which minimal size goes around 64GB. It can be more depending of the distribution you like to install. This computer-on-a-stick will have two distinct partitions:

- A dedicated space where the linux OS system lays ( <= 15 GB)
- Internal Driver Disk where to store your change (the remaining size left by the system)

So don't wait anymore, try linux and be happy to become a developer , because developers leads . Consumers follows. Take the Power to change how you interact with your device , knowing almost most of the times what is going on and how to deal with it. You will become a little more proud of you.
