### OPENING

**Situation** ( technical ) : Alright , so deal with a mess up stick USB right now. You lost your files, you can’t access them, when you’re Plug-in in on your computer, it’s not even recognize, all that sort of stuff.

**Transition** : It is petty gnarly situation.

**Topics to cover** : Well, today I’m gonna be giving you the best methods that I know of that will allow you to gain access to your drive as well as hopefully in the end, get your files back. And we are gonna be covering it all on a windows 10 PC. So let’s get started.

<br/>

### BODY

#### 1.about the issue in general

**Situations** ( in details ) : But when it comes to a corrupted flash drive what is that even look like typically ? Like what are the telltale sign that you have got some data or software corruption going on your usb drive ?

`Transition` : Well there is few.

**Situation 1** : “ Missing Files ”

So first of all, the main one would be if you attempt to plug in your flash drive and you can’t even pull up any of the files, you can’t even open any of them, you know right. Or there’s even some missing , and you know that you didn’t delete them.

`Transition` : That is a pretty sure for sign that something fishing is going on the software end.

**Situation `**: “ Issues accessing the files/drive ”

If you can’t even access the drive at all, like you plug it in and it’s just dead, there is no response from your computer. Or if you try to copy or paste something to and from the drive and it’s not working at all, or it say you need to format the drive in order for it to be usable again.

`Transition` : Then those are all signs there’s something going on here that needs fixing and it’s most likely software related.

`Transition` -> next topic : Yes , those are all signs that something is going on with the drive, but what’s the next step ? Like what do you do next ?

**Topics to cover** : Well, I’m gonna go over two sort of classes methods that are both really comprehensive and we will cover most of your bases in terms of getting all of your files off the drive, or at least gaining access to the drive so that it’s usable again, without loosing all your stuff.

<br/>

#### 1.about the tools to use

**A/ Tool 1**

**argument-1** : And we are gonna start by using **data recovery software** to pull files off the drive, even if the drive is not recognized by the PC. So for situations like this data recovery is absolutely amazing, i use it all the time. And the cool thing is, is that's able to read a drive even without any help of Windows Explorer or a Disk Manager, meaning that it's almost like a separate entity and that it can gain access to your drive when it appears it doesn't even work.

`Transition`: so that it's a huge plus.

And the cool thing is, is that the sofware we are using today is called **Disk Drill**. And the amazing thing about it is that , it has some of the most advanced recovery algorithms in the space, especially when it comes to recovering files from a corrupted USB drive. And when you download it for `Windows` you can recover up to 500 Megabytes of files for free. So i'm gonna leave a link down below in the description to where you  
can download and install **_Disk Drill_**.
`Transition`: But once you download and install it, then go ahead and open it up.

And at this point it would be a good idea to make sure that your USB is plugged into your PC. And then once it is plugged in, it will be recognizable inside of Disk Drill right inside the disk list, which iss in the center. Now one thing we really should do before we actually begin to san the drive for files, is to perform a **byte to byte backup** of the drive. And what is mean is that it is going to create and exact mirror image of whatever is on that fdrive into a separate location, which we could from later if something happens to be awry on the drive or we overwrite something or just something in the process goes wrong and we need to actually pull a fresh version of that drive from the time before we started actually running the scan and attempting to recover the files. The cool thing about Disk Drill is that it got an amazing byte to byte backup feature built right into it.

**Tool usage - Action 1**: Then all we need to do , is:

- go to backup, then select your corrupted USB drive, then hit byte to byte backup.
- choose your safe location and give it a name if you want , and hit OK.

And then once this process is finished, make sure that you store this file in a safe and secure location and then head back to Disk Drill. And then open up the **data recovering panel** and head back to the disk list.

`Transition`: Okay so now we are actually ready to go ahead and scan the drive for files. And now the cool thing about the backup that we just made is that it actually doubles as a disk image that we can scan inside of Disk Drill. And this will help us to avoid any potential errors or things going awry during the recovery process.

So all we need to do is :

- click attach disk image
- then select the backup file that you just created, and this will add it in the list where we can select it.
- choose our recovery method
- then hit search for lost data.

`Transition` : So now of course, depending on the size of your drive and how much data you actually lost, this may take a few minutes. So i'm going to speed this process up and i will come back once it's done.

**Tool usage - Action 2** : Alright, so the process is finished and now what we can do is just click this little blue button up here, which will take us to all of the files that were found during the scan. So now, we can browse around through the files in the middle here, also in the left hand side via the categories for photos, videos.

There is also a search bar up in the top right if you know the file by name or you knew the file extension all the time that it was deleted.

But once you find the files that you are looking for, go ahead and put a check mark next to them. Then go down and hit recover and choose your save location. Now one thing that is very important, **do not export the files** that you are trying to recover to that USB drive from which you are trying to recover that's is very important because then you actually risk overwriting them. So i am actually going to export them to my desktop here. It's what i normally do and click OK. Now as you can see the files have returned to the desktop. They are in great shape, just like they never left

`Transition` : Okay that is the **first method** and that is honestly the one that i prefer to use the most because it's the one that is the most robust and that gives me files in the least amount of time.

**B/ Tool 2**

**argument-1** : But there are some others hat you can try just in case you have a different scenario going on. Like for instance if you plug the drive in and it is recognized but not inside Windows Explorer. So it's essentially mountable, but you can't pull the files off, you can read them inside Windows Explorer. And if that's the case, then the simple solution might be to just :

- reset some of the metadata inside the drive.

Which can allow it to be reinstalled or re-recognized inside the PC that will allow you to get the files. So it's really simple and there is a few methods that you can try.

`Transition` : so here we go.

**solution-1** : The first thing you can do is to assign a different drive letter. So you can do this by:

- right clicking the start icon and hitting Disk Management.
- then right click on the disk number for your USB
- then click change driver letter and paths
- then click on the driver letter that is already assigned and hit change
- choose a new drive letter that it is not being used by any other drive on your computer and hit Ok.

<br/>

**solution-2** : And the second thing that you could try is to update and reinstall the drivers. So you can think of drivers as a sort of **communication pathway** between and operating system and a device. It is like an extension of the software that if its get interrupted, then it would be not readable.

`Transition` : And it's a pretty simple fix actually. So here is how we can do it.

Make sure your drive is plugged in, of course.

- then right click the start icon again , and then hit Device Manager.
- then expand the dropdown list for your disk drives.
- then right click on you USB Drive and hit uninnstall Device.
- then just go ahead and unplug your USB and then plug it back again.

And this will trigger the latest drivers to be downloded and install automatically.

**solution-2** : Now the last way that you can troubleshoot this thing is by actually using a few command inside **CMD**, like **attrib** and the **check the disk command**. I have actually this before to get rid of a broken system on a drive that i shot a wedding with a while back. Uh , but the cool thing about this is that it helps to just relieve some of that pressure that comes from a broken file system. So it is a littl ebit technical, i will warn you. But i'm gonna run through all the steps here. So just follow all the way through and you shouldn't have any problems. so go ahead and :

- click on the start menu and then search for cmd
- then go ahead and enter this command in the command line and replace D with drive letter of your USB and press enter.
- And then will cause `Windows` to verify all the`files and folders on that USB Stick
- And then last but not least, to unhide those files, enter this command again replacing D with the drive letter of your USB stick, and then hit enter once more .

So again, this last method is pretty niche and usually only works for a bad file system, but if it did work and it allowed your drive to be recognized by the computer again, then that's awesome.

### ENDING

And that's about all i got . So that's it. Those are the best methods that i know of to actually recover files from a corrupted USB flash drive, uh, and to get them off safely.
