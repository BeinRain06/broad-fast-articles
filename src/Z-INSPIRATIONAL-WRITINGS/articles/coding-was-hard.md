## CODE WAS HARD UNTIL I LEARNED THIS

by **Catherine Li** - Youtube

<br/>

### OPENING

**Situation ( apprehension )**: “ Learning To Code is a difficult and a times overwhelming journey. It feels like there are billions things you need to learn ; and the minutes you feel like you have actually mastered something it becomes outdated. “

**Personal feelings ( situation )**: “ There where times when I even questioned if coding really was for me. There where concepts that took so long to grasp it’s as if everyone else had this intuition for programming that I didn’t have but as it turns out I was walking the process a lot harder than it really needed to be. “

**About Me + Topics to cover** : “ My Name is Catherine Li and I have nearly 9 years of working as a Software Developer and in this video I want to share with you some of the mistakes that I made when I was learning to code so that maybe you can avoid these pitfalls and learn a lot more efficiently with web development”

**Situation ( supporting sentence )** : “ In particular there’s always a hot new text stack or framework and the options are endless. Everyone’s always asking what they should be learning and which skills are going to have the highest **ROI (Return On Investment)**. Personally if I were to start to learn to code again . I wouldn’t be spending all that time stressing about what the best framework to learn Is?”

**Situation ( story support )** : “ I was reading this books by Morgan Housel called “Same as Ever” and the basic premise is that : “the only constant in life is change and change is virtually impossible to predict despite what people on Youtube will say.” This is essentially the case when it comes to web development. We have no idea which Frameworks are going to be popular in the future. No one truly knows what kind of impact AI is going to have in the next decade. There’s people that say AI is going to take all software developer jobs within the next 5 years and people saying that there is no way is going to happen in our lifetime and both sides sound equally confident .

`Transition & General Solution release` : “ That being said there are **computer science and programming Concepts** that will almost always be useful regardless if you’re going for interviews or you’re using them for a job or both. These fundamentals transferrable skills will give you the most bang for your buck if you master. If you master these concepts it doesn’t matter as much which framework is trending and which one is going out of style because because you are going to be able to pick them up a lot faster not to mention the work becomes a lot more rewarding when you actually understand what the heck you’re doing Concepts like :

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**

- **System Design**
- **Writing Good Tests**
- **Design Patterns**

they are always going to be useful regardless of what’s trending . Because those skills are transferable. This is a hot take bu even if you learn a dying language or framework. If you master the underlying Concepts. It is not necessarily a waste of time.”

Solutions

S**olution 1** : “If you master the underlying Concepts. It is not necessarily a waste of time.”

Example : “For Example one of the first language that I learn was PHP and you can laught all you want but one it was very beginner friendly so it’s helped me stay motivated and two it helped me learn other object oriented programming languages down the line like Java and Ruby.

**Solution 2** : “Everyone learns differently.”

Example : “Imagine you’re learning javascript and you see this : “the promise represents the eventual completion (or a failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value”. Phew this can look intimidatingly complex and discouraging to someone news to javascript. To this day I’m still intimidated when I read API Documentation and there’s so much technical jargon that I don’t understand. Some people learn well by skimming online or reading and I know now that I learn best through watching videos and going through examples so if you are like me and you don’t understand things you read right away. Don’t immediately jump to the conclusion that programming is too hard and you are not smart enough to understand it. As soon as I watched a few Youtube Videos on “Javascript Promise” . I couldn’t believe how simple the concept really was > So before you start telling yourself these stories about how you can’t understand programming Concepts. Keep in Mind that both the medium and the quality of instruction plays a massive role in whether or not you learn something.”

**Solution 3** : “ Stop watching tutorials ”

Example : “Whether or not you’re learning something there’s nothing wrong with watching series of two if you’re just starting to learn a new framework or a new language. But passively watching or reading information is actually one of the most inefficient way to learn and retain information. Tutorials will teach you the information and the syntax but if you really want the information to solidify and you want to understand and think like an engineer. You need to find ways to **apply these concepts** to your own real projects or real world applications. Came to this realisation when I was watching a series on react hooks. I remember finishing the entire series and I feel like I understood everything that was said in the videos, But as soon I started trying to work to an actual project I was like a deer in highlights. While I was understood the syntax on a surface level i didn’t always recognize where the best times to use them and what were the downsides of using a certain react hook . I only how to apply them in the very narrow context of that particular tutorials tha I have watched. It’s only after I got a lo of practice implementing them in different scenarios with different types of real data did I start to recognize the patterns and see when I should be using a certain hook like useEffect or useContext . These are obviously examples but you get what I mean here’s why so many of us fall into this tutorial hell it’s because it is easy, it’s comfortable. You’re watching someone else code. You follow along by typing exactly what they’re typing on screen you barely **even need to think** and there isn’t really much of a risk of failure threatens our Ego and it feels bad and so we do everything in our power to avoid it in the short term this feels really good. We get a dopamine hit because we feel like we learned a bunch of new syntax and we are deluded into thinking that we learned a lot more than we actually did. What worked for me is :

- watching one tutorials series on a language or a framework that I’m trying to learn
- As I’m watching it I test myself on what I learned
- I actively apply it to a project ”.

`Transition`: “ So stops preparing to code and just start instead of just watching tutorials try something that’s a little bit more Hands-On”

**Advetizing (Marketing Message)** : “ And that is why today’s sponsor Brillant is the perfect way start learning new courses and skills in only 15 minutes a day . I have been using Brillant on my own to learn new skills and to freshen up my knowledge on topics that I was taught in the past and I find their learning approach much more useful because of their guides and the ability to see my code in action. Just recently I finished their update course on “How LLM’s Work” which helps me answer some questions that I had on LLMs and also to satisfy my curiosity of wanting to know more about LLMs that are everywhere these days. The way that I can easily change a slider or two and see different results in real time really helps me grasp the fundamentals concepts and I definitely feel that I have better understanding of LLMs. If you enjoy learning new skills, have a 15 min a day to spend learning anywhere and on the go I will recommend signing for Brillant for free for a full 30 days using “brillant.org/CatherineLi” or by scanning the QR Code on the screen or you can click on the link in the description you will also get 20% off an annual premium subscription ”

**Solution 4** : “ Growth Mindset”

Example : “One of the worst feelings in the world is when you’re sitting in class and the instructor and the instructor asks a really challenging question that you have no clue as to what the answer is. To make matter worse there is **bunch students that appear to grasp the concepts** and seems to possess that intuition you lack. It’s even worst when it happens a work there’s countless times where I would be banging my head against a wall for hours and I finally have the courage to ask another to take a look at It and they figure it out within minutes. You start thinking to yourself and questioning yourself : “am I not cut out for this ? Why are they so much smarter than me ? I am to dumb for this career!” . Let me just assure you right away that everyone feels this way at one point or another I feel like this on a weekly basis and there is a reason why Impostor Syndrome is so rampant among software Engineers . I have Actually been on the other side of this scenario , as well when I was helping a junior engineer after I helped them solve their problem they asked me how I fixed and issue fairly quickly that they have been dealing with for nearly an hour and the reason is simple I have seen that bug happen before several times it was simply the case that I’ve experienced this before , not that I was more talented or in . Intelligent people mistakes lack of Experience with a lack of Intelligence all the time but the two could not be more different . If you really struggle with Impostor Syndrome like I do I highly recommend you check out **the book “Mindset” by Carol S Dweck , Ph.D.** It is only after I internalized the belief that **programming is simply a group of skills** that I anybody can get better at with enough time and effort and there’s nothing magical about it, that I became much more empowered to tackle the challenge and try new things. ”

**Solution 5** : “ Embrace Discomfort ad Failure”

Example : “I noticed a common denominator among the best software Developer I have worked with , and that is **their High frustration Tolerance** from the outset they accept that thing might go wrong, it won’t work right away and **that is OK!**. In fact it might be good because it means that they are learning something new. The best Engineers that I’ve worked with have all had so much grit and they are willing to **tolerate uncertainty** and dive into an area that they are not familiar with, **they are willing to struggle** with problems without getting too frustrated or giving up. Everyone goes through this and the **ability to regulate your emotions** when frustrations comes up is a critical skill rather than seeing unexpected problems as obstacles the best Engineers understand that it’s simply a part of the job they factor in time for dealing with unexpected issues when estimating scope for a particular feature. When I started coding I remember I would get so frustrated when I was working on a project and all of a sudden git doesn’t work as expected , the API suddenly change, the server won’t start or some other nonsense. One of the best mindset hacks that I have adopted that’s made learning programming a little less stressful is accepting that is going to be difficult the fact that learning to code is difficult and not a lot of people are willing to tolerate this kind of difficulty is on of the reasons why Tech salaries are so high it’s what make learning to code so valuable In fact these days if I’m working on a project or doing a job where their is **absolutely no discomfort or failure I might actually see that as a sign that I’m not challenging myself enough.**”

Solution 6 : “Go Outside and Touch Grass”

Example : “A lot of you are going to sleep on this one but in my opinion this is one of the most underrated hacks Ali Abdaal has said that **an hour in the morning is worth two** after 3:00 p.m . I would even go as far as saying that **an hour of uninterrupted deep work** after a full night AR rest and some extra exercise is worth than 2 , 3 , four times an hour after 3:00 p.m . Just think about how productive you are the first hour of coding versus the fourth, fifth , sixth . After all programming is very much cognitively demanding task and it’s not like folding laundry where your level of otuput remains pretty steady over time rather than trying to brute force your productivity by coding for 12 hours a day a more effective strategy could just simply to focus uninterrupted for 4 to 6 hours and spent the res of the times recharging , getting some sleep and exercise so that you can increase the quality and leverage of those hours . Cal Newport(“ Deep Work”) who’s written some of my favorite books has said that people only deep work for up to 4 hours a day . Now I don’t know where he got that exact figure from, but personally I find that 4 to 5 hours of deep focus on a really mentally intensive tasks seems to be the upper limit for me as well by using the rest of the time to recharge and sleep or even just do less mentally challenging work like answering emails or going to meetings. You can dramatically improve how productive you are during those critical 4 to 6 hours. Not to mention being in the flow for 4 to 6 hours and having time to actually live your life outside of work is so much more sustainable and enjoyable than trying to grind for 12 hours a day . There is a ton of evidence out there that says even a little bit of exercise increases your ability to learn. Speaking from personal experience if I’m stressed out over a bug just going outside briefly for a walk or a run immediately makes me more relaxed and ready to tackle the problem once get back to it. If you can’t do that sometimes just even leaving the problem alone for a period of time and coming back to it it will give you a fresh perspective and new ideas on **how to solve it** . if you found ”
